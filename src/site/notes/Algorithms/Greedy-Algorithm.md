A greedy algorithm is an approach to solving problems that involves making a sequence of choices at each step with the hope of finding the optimal solution. At each step, the greedy algorithm selects the best option available based on some criteria, without considering the global picture or future consequences. It makes a series of locally optimal choices in the hope that these choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

Key characteristics of greedy algorithms include:

1. Greedy Choice Property: A greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each step based on some criteria without considering the past or future choices. It assumes that making the locally optimal choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.

2. No Backtracking: Greedy algorithms don't backtrack or reconsider choices made in the past. Once a decision is made, it's final.

3. Not Always Optimal: Greedy algorithms do not guarantee finding the optimal solution for all problems. In some cases, they may produce suboptimal or incorrect results.

4. Efficiency: Greedy algorithms are often simple and efficient in terms of time complexity because they make a series of quick, local decisions.

5. Used in Optimisation Problems: Greedy algorithms are commonly used in optimization problems where the goal is to maximize or minimize a certain objective function.

Examples of problems where greedy algorithms are applied include:

- Finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph (e.g., Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms).
- Finding the shortest path in a graph (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
- Scheduling tasks to minimize completion time (e.g., job scheduling problems).
- Coin change problem (making change with the fewest coins).
- Huffman coding for data compression.
- Fractional knapsack problem (selecting items to maximize value within a weight limit).

While greedy algorithms can be powerful and efficient, it's important to note that they are not suitable for all types of problems. They work well when the greedy choice property is satisfied, but for many problems, a more comprehensive search or dynamic programming approach may be required to guarantee an optimal solution.
