In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **streaming algorithms** are algorithms for processing [data streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream "Data stream") in which the input is presented as a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of items and can be examined in only a few passes, typically [just one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-pass_algorithm "One-pass algorithm"). These algorithms are designed to operate with limited memory, generally [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_(complexity) "L (complexity)") in the size of the stream and/or in the maximum value in the stream, and may also have limited processing time per item.

As a result of these constraints, streaming algorithms often produce approximate answers based on a summary or "sketch" of the data stream.
