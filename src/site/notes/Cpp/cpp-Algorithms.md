The algorithms library defines functions for a variety of purposes (e.g. searching, sorting, counting, manipulating) that operate on ranges of elements. Note that a range is defined as **`[`first`,`Â last`) ** where last refers to the element _past_ the last element to inspect or modify.

***Predicate*** is a callable that returns a value testable as a `bool`. #cppTrivia
